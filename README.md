# Full Stack Development with Java Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB â€“ Full Course
This project is my implementation of the [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PdEmeopJVQ) of FreeCodeCamp.org

## Structure
In this project, we have 2 main directories:
- [movie-api](movie-api/)
- [movie-client](movie-client/)

Each directory holds one "service" of the application, the [movie-api](movie-api/) is the back-end and the [movie-client](movie-client/) the front-end

## How to run the project
In order to run this project, the following steps are required:
1. Configure the .env files
2. Run the back-end
3. Run the front-end

Obs: to run, the back-end you'll need a [jdk](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed in your computer and follow your IDE tutorial on how run maven projects, for instance, the [vscode tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-build).
